## Problem 1
Given a list of positive integer Items whose elements are guaranteed to be in sorted ascending order, and a positive integer Goal, and Output  is a list of three elements [A,B,C] 
taken from items that together add up to goal. The Output must occur inside the items list in that order (ascending order).

## Problem 2
Daisy loves playing games with words. Recently, she has been playing the following Deletive Editing word game with Daniel. Daisy picks a word, for example, 
"DETERMINED". On each game turn, Daniel calls out a letter, for example, 'E', and Daisy removes the first occurrence of this letter from the word, getting "DTERMINED".
On the next turn, Daniel calls out a letter again, for example, 'D', and Daisy removes its first occurrence, getting "TERMINED". They continue with 'I', getting "TERMNED", with 'N', getting "TERMED", and with 'D',
getting "TERME". Now, if Daniel calls out the letter 'E', Daisy gets "TRME", but there is no way she can get the word "TERM" if they start playing with the word "DETERMINED".
Daisy is curious if she can get the final word of her choice, starting from the given initial word, by playing this game for zero or more turns. Your task it help her to figure this out.
